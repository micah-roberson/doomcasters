Verses of the Before-Time

In the hush before hunger,
Before breath bore weight,
Before flame had name,
There lay Stillness—
A cradle unshaken, a sleep never dreamt.

From Stillness, a Thought wavered.
Not made. Not born. Simply was.
It turned its hollow gaze upon the Nothing,
And in its emptiness declared: "This shall be whole."

Thus fell the first falsehood.

From that fracture, shadows bled.
Not beasts. Not stars. But Questions.
They wandered not to find—but to unravel.
And so began the Era of Mute Echoes.

Worlds were not woven; they spilled,
Cracks from a shattered vessel,
Each dripping its own gnawing need.

Of Flame and Form

The Eld stood watchless, but wondered.
They touched the lands with thoughts,
Etched winds with intent,
And whispered fire into clay.

From that whisper came the Lesser—
Not weak. Not wise. But willing.
They cut stone from stillness,
Fed flame with forests,
Sang names into sky.

Some Eld wept. Some turned. One listened.

When the Maw Stirred

Not born. Not summoned.
It waited beyond weight, outside time's tether.
It knew no hunger—it was hunger.

The Lesser dug deep.
They sang too loud.
They reached, and the veil split.

The Maw did not rise.
It opened.

And the Eld turned away.

Of Whispers and Wounds

The brave? They begged.
The cunning? They bargained.
The hollow? They heard.

The Maw offered no gift—only license.
To end. To unmake. To taste.

And so the Circle of Ruin was drawn,
Not in blood, but in consent.

They came not to protect.
They came not to heal.
They came to unravel.

Thus walked the Doomcasters.

The Cracking of the Tapestry

Lands turned in on themselves.
Waters boiled with memory.
Skies bled from too many dawns.
Time slipped its tether and ran.

Temples fell to silence,
The Eld vanished beneath memory,
The Lesser clawed at sand and spell.

But the Doomcasters fulfilled.
Each ruin, an offering.
Each collapse, a song in the Maw’s ear.

Fragments from the Void-Scribed Leaves

They built towers to pierce silence,
Stacked on bones, lined with stars.
Their hands bled silver, their tongues spoke stone.

Yet still they thirsted.

The Eld did not punish. They waited.
For silence to return.
For the page to turn.
For the maw to widen.

Ash Verses

A whisper is not a word.
A name is not a self.
A crown is not a throne.

In the end, all is paper.
And paper burns.

Chants of the Broken Glyphs

Hollowed eyes beneath hollow suns.
Spells cast in fear, then fury, then pride.
The skies grew tired of remembering.

So they forgot.

Mountains crumbled inward,
Rivers climbed the trees,
And Time began to chew its own tail.

The Final Verse

Reader, bearer, breaker
—
The script is not yet ash.
You arrive not first. Nor last.

You feel the thrum.
Not desire. Not hope. But the pull.

Perhaps you will rend to protect.
Perhaps only to prove.

But know:
Each crack cries.
Each silence listens.
Each name dissolves in the Maw’s mouth.

There is no end. Only the closing of the loop.

Step forward. Let the page consume you.
